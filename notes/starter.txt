Hello and welcome to wonderful world of Jescube.

My name is Zhen and I am your tournament organizer today,
We will be starting off today with 3 pack booster draft I know most of you have drafted before,
but just to review you will be opening 3 packs that's in front of you,
once you open the first pack you will be picking a card and passing the pack to the player on your left,
for the second back you will be picking a card and passing the pack to the player on your right,
and for the 3rd and last back you will pass it to the player on your left again.

We will be doing zone drafting rules, you pass a pack to someone and they haven't picked it up yet,
please keep the pack you are about to pass them in your hand and wait for you pick up your next pack.
Once all the packs have opened and we have finished drafting, you will have 30 mins to build your deck.

Round one will start at that point.
There are no offical time limit per round
but to keep the event rolling, please do not go over 1 hour for your round.

We will be doing a Causal Swiss tournament format.
Each time you finish a round please report the games results to me.
The Cube machine App will let me know if you currently have an available opponent that best matches up with your record.
But you can play anyone you will that you haven't played before, the App is here to suggest best match ups.

One last thing please do not take your deck apart once you finished or have to left.
Please leave the deck on the deck with your player number of top of it so we know who drafted what.
The decks will be saved into a database and archived to help improve the cube for future events.

That's it, please open your first booster and have fun.
